<h1> E-commerce with Flask (Simplified version) </h1>
<br>
A project designed to simulate a e-commerce with Flask, where you have login / register and sell and buy items.
<br>
The project uses SQLite3 to the database, and creates automatically when you run the file 'run.py' inside the flask_market folder, all the templates and static files are in templates folder, and they uses jinja templates to access back-end variables.
<br><br>
The project was produced by Jim from JimShapedCoding and modified by me. You can access his channel in <strong>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8d7rcShA7MGuDyYH1aWGg</strong>
